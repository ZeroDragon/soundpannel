## Use as remote controller
At the botton of the screen there is an URL, make sure you are on the same network and open that URL from any smartphone. Form there, tap any button and Sound Pannel will react and execute it.

## Use overlay in streaming
Just add `/overlay` to the URL and add that to your [OBS](https://obsproject.com) or [Xplit](https://www.xsplit.com/) software, any animation triggered by the Sound Pannel will be animated there.
